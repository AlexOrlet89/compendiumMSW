#PLAN
Where else to start but at the beginning. Go to App and create a <Home />
Home will have a view list of characters and above that will have a sort function

Alright lets do some fetching, find out if this JOJO api is going to cut it. cuts it, comes back as a single object, lets set it to state and get to dissecting it as needed, I think we will filter by series.
data is destructured, the values of our keys are arrays and those arrays are grabbed and then spreadinto one large array'
lets map it out onto the page.
Alright it has been mapped onto the page (Stands)
