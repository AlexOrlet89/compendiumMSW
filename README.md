#PLAN
Where else to start but at the beginning. Go to App and create a <Home />
Home will have a view list of characters and above that will have a sort function

Alright lets do some fetching, find out if this JOJO api is going to cut it. cuts it, comes back as a single object, lets set it to state and get to dissecting it as needed, I think we will filter by series.
